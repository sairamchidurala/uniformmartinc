    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
    <p>At <strong>UniformmartInc</strong>, we're on a mission to make finding school uniforms simple, accurate, and
        even a little bit fun! 🎉</p>

    <p>We started this platform to solve one simple problem: <em>why is it so hard to find the right uniform for
            your school?</em> Our team curated a massive database of over 300+ schools across the U.S. to provide
        verified, updated uniform information — with images, sizes, and category filtering.</p>

    <p>Whether you're a parent, student, or school administrator, UniformmartInc makes uniform discovery easy and
        joyful 🏫✨.</p>
